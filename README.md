# python-exercises

This repository and the files that are in it were basically my first interactions with one programming language... and Java script but I do not have too many records of it and Python is what I preferred to learn as a person who was trying to immerse herself in the data world.

Here there are many independent basics level exercises about syntaxis, simple maths, data types, conditionals, For loop and while loops, and more!
